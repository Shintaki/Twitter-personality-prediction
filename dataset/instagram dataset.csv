She would have been 12 in a few months. On some level we'd been preparing for this for a while--she'd been diagnosed with kidney failure a little over a year ago--but these final few days, when things took a sudden turn, were still so shocking and unexpected. I'm thankful she's no longer struggling, and that I was with her in the last moments, scratching her cheek and head in the way only I knew how.Over this last decade, she was truly MY kitty. When I worked overseas for a while I left her with my folks for about three months. The first morning I was back she immediately jumped into my lap and snuggled up against me, something my parents said had never happened in her time there. Beth can attest to the numerous times Enid would yowl with loneliness when I was gone, but would completely ignore her when Beth would call ""hey, I'm right here!"" There was only one person she truly wanted, and I'm glad I got to feel her soft fur one last time this morning. |||Well, I wasn‚Äôt expecting THIS when I went to water plants |||@betherby waiting patiently for the cheese to brown |||Turns out the AiBnB we staid at was double booked for the last night |||Gardening Weekend 2: Organic Bugaloo |||Self care lunch views |||Did I get misty eyed watching a striptease set to Rainbow Connection?

Jeg har ingen ambitioner om at blive som jeg var f√∏r, men jeg arbejder mig altid hen mod mit bedste liv og ikke lade angst st√• i vejen for det.

christianross,enfj,0,0,0,1," |||Went for a run today at lunch. Got locked out of the office when everybody else left.Decided to offset all net gains with an iced mocha from @redefinedcoffeehouse (Also, I just told @melanieross this weekend that I started running in 2020.) #grapevinetx |||@melanieross snuck one past me this week and picked me up a signed copy of the new Lone Bellow! //‚ÄúShe rewards him with good, not evil, all the days of her life.‚Äù //Marry up, yo. |||I‚Äôve gotten my fill of spelling bees for a while, #48 took his turn today at the middle school level.

So proud of him for overcoming fears and getting second place as a 4th grader in a mostly 5th grade field!...Truth be told, I would have missed it too. Way to go Keegs! |||Dad brag: On Saturday, this guy balled out of his mind. He threw a complete game no-hitter, walking only 1 batter, and giving up 1 run. I‚Äôm pretty lucky to get to be called his dad (but frankly, that has very little to do with baseball). |||Just one of those moments where wish you could just freeze time. Two dudes in their natural habitat. Play forever, boys. |||Took a little longer than I‚Äôd care to admit but I finally got the custom shutters I built hung on the house yesterday. Brings some needed texture to the front of our house. ... (I posted this in B&W because I don‚Äôt really want you to get distracted by the current color of my lawn. It‚Äôs kind of hard to keep it green when we‚Äôre still hitting 95F in mid October.) |||A few days late on this but this ü¶ä and I celebrated 19 years down the aisle this week. We‚Äôve got a pretty good thing going. |||3:15am wake up call. Guessing my neighbor will be getting a new truck.

From 1972. //Looks like it was a gift from Mrs. Brewer to Andrew Coles for Christmas in 1975. Hope little Andy made some sweet radios with this guide. |||This is the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen this week. Well done, @cultivarcoffee. |||Had a client of ours blow us away today with this custom piece he built. He found a 1959 Oldsmobile Ninety Eight emblem at an antique store and flipped and mounted it for us [eightninety]! Thankful for them and all of our great partners today. |||Spent the last four days with 6500 baseball coaches from all over North America at the #abcaconvention2019. Great experience and proud to have gone with over 35 other @gograpevine youth coaches! |||Looks like Hermie the Elf and his boys traded some money last night. #pocketaces |||I got approval from @melanieross for this mischief by calling this a ‚Äòscience experiment.‚Äô No cops were called but we did scare the neighbor. #funsideofparenting |||A little calm before the storm in the Christmas Capitol of Texas. Chairs were actually lined up at about 10am today on Main Street for the Parade of Lights. |||We might be terrible but we‚Äôre at least going to be a best-dressed terrible team. #baseballoffseason |||Serving this morning. Love these dudes and their hearts for others. |||Was fun watching this little dude take the mound for his first time tonight! He was grinning from ear-to-ear and fairly nervous (as was I!).

Tomorrow we‚Äôre heading to Rome! |||We were able to hit 4 of the 5 villages of Cinque Terre in one day. They‚Äôre only accessible via boat, train, or by hiking from one to the next along a 22-mile trail. Amazing! |||Venice was incredible.

I don't own a table saw or router yet, so I had to do all of this by hand (chisel and handsaw). Took forever! But I learned a ton. |||Abortion in the US was legalized 44 years ago today. Since then, 60 million babies have been killed. One more time ... 60 million babies have been killed. Shocking stat, huh? Well, maybe not to everyone. Thousands of women (and men) have participated in marches and protests across our county the last few days. Some are actually really dear friends of mine. Of course, I'm not saying that all of those people (including my friends) are in support of abortion. It's just one issue in the overall agenda behind women's rights. And yes, I know that President Trump is one major reason for the movement. He's said and done many many horrible things ... especially toward women. I get that. I'm embarrassed by it. It makes me angry. And sad. Sure, speak out against that all day everyday. But to march for a woman's right to murder unborn children ... I'll never in a million years understand why that makes sense to anyone with a heart. |||We miss you and love you, Mom. This first Christmas without you is so hard. Tell Jesus we said Happy Birthday. |||Dang, the moon is surrounded by a big halo tonight. So beautiful! |||Watching Monsters University and snuggling with the cutest little girl on the planet.

ibvanmat,infj,1,0,0,1," |||Be back soon Chattanooga. You remain one of the few places on earth I will always be able to call ‚Äúhome‚Äù. |||Colorado showing off. Five weeks till DST. |||Sunset through the trees |||Up the Palace! Heck of a hard fought draw today against the defending Champions. Wilfred Zaha is worth $80 million and not a penny less. #cpfc |||More scenes from the multiverse #multiverse |||Scenes from the multiverse |||That was one hell of a trip. Four hours later I understand something about the multiverse but also feel like I know nothing. It‚Äôs bizarre and wonderful and dense af. Would take several trips and severe risk to the mind to make full sense of it all. #multiverse |||Field trip to the multiverse. |||It has been a decade. If you are reading this, we‚Äôve survived. That‚Äôs something. Some of my friends haven‚Äôt.When I look back it‚Äôs a bit daunting to consider how much has changed. The whole decade feels like two halves.At the end of 2009, I had finally managed to move to Denver. But it was on the back of a pretty major failure at a job/career I thought I‚Äôd be really good at. I‚Äôd also just taken my mom on an amazing trip of a lifetime to Vienna, but even that was bittersweet as it was also the beginning of the end of the relationship that had brought me back there.In the early part of this decade, I had to start over from scratch. And that‚Äôs what I did. I struggled but found work. I went out and made new lifelong friends. I even fell into new relationships, which, while they didn‚Äôt last, taught me the importance of communication, listening, how to have your heart broken, and more importantly how to mend it and how to be comfortable being alone.The first half of the decade I was filled with hope for the future of the world and our country, but pretty down on my own life and future.Everything flipped in the latter half. While I‚Äôm increasingly pessimistic about the world and the rise of everything awful in the last four years, I‚Äôve been much luckier in my personal life. I‚Äôve grown as a person. I‚Äôve traveled to places I‚Äôd only dreamed of. I made new lifelong friends. I found communities of creative, like-minded people that I can‚Äôt wait to engage with more in the new decade.I‚Äôve never been more excited or terrified of what comes next. I have a (rough) plan. Execution will be in the details. I‚Äôve become more flexible, more calm, more focused, and sometimes I almost feel ready for the challenges ahead.Here‚Äôs to 2020 being the start of an amazing decade for all of us, full of love and challenges and successes and failures and bouncebacks and survival. Happy New Year! |||Started the day with a Winter Warmer-style beer to celebrate the solstice. Finishing up the day with another (don‚Äôt worry, I abstained in between). #embracethedarkness #solstice |||Merry Krampusnacht! Better be on the lookout tonight or Krampus will get ya. #krampusnacht |||Today was a late but very good mail day. About 8 more of these to find to complete my collection (afaik). #shakespeare #books |||Happy Candlenights! The pan-religious, pan-sexual, personal pan winter holiday season. #mbmbam |||Beauty is a choice.I think we sometimes forget that. Our society incentivizes us to judge constantly, to always see the negative, to tear down anyone or anything that dares to rise above the fray.But it‚Äôs still our choice to participate. To comment or tweet or be rude to someone just because we can. It‚Äôs so easy to resort to ugliness.This Fall has been the worst weather I think I‚Äôve ever experienced in Colorado. Snowstorms came early and haven‚Äôt stopped coming. The last one was the biggest in 25 years. Tonight it snowed yet again. Not for long, but long enough to really drive home how shitty it‚Äôs been.We haven‚Äôt even hit December and it already feels like we‚Äôve had more snow than entire years previous to this. It‚Äôs disheartening. It‚Äôs hard to get around the city. It‚Äôs hard to even want to leave the warmth of home.Tonight I was determined to go out anyway. To see good friends and to imbibe good drinks and to have good conversations that probably won‚Äôt change the world but at least might make both participants think just a little bit deeper than before.Sure we commiserated about the weather. Hard not to. It‚Äôs easy to complain. But on the way home I chose to walk a few extra blocks out of my way to the park nearby to take this picture.With the snow covered field in the foreground and the skyline of the city I love standing against the horizon, it was easy to stop, in the cold, with wet snow creeping into my shoes, and choose to see the beauty of this moment on a cold, snowy night. Just the beauty of the snow and the lights of the city against the dark sky.These moments are always there, all around us. We just have to stop and choose to see them. To choose them over the ugliness.Beauty is a choice. |||Now is the time to get fat and happy. |||Man what a perfect day. #denver #cowx |||Best art show of the year, always.

It features individual slide-in trays for each player's personal stuff, and plenty of space on the main tabletop for maps, etc. The legs fold up into the main body, the trays store underneath the tabletop, and the two halves collapse and latch together for storage.The main body was made of Birch and Birch plywood, while the legs are made of solid Red Oak. Everything is stained dark walnut, with about 4 coats of semi-gloss lacquer finish, to provide protection and some spill-proofing.

The doctors had us go ahead and do a steroid shot and magnesium IV Monday to help develop the lungs and prevent brain bleeding. Preparing for early delivery if it comes to that.Baby A has grown and is the 95th percentile and B made it in the 3rd percentile this week, finally hitting over 400 grams! The NICU doctor was happy about that yesterday and said let‚Äôs hope to get to 25 weeks and a little more weight.We‚Äôre praying for 30+ weeks of course!The double profile of both in the same shot from last week is pretty rare and even the sonographer was excited to get it. üòäWe go back tomorrow and then MWF for a couple weeks. Thank you for the continued prayers and support!! ‚ù§Ô∏è #siugr #identicaltwins #moditwins |||Appointments last week and this week so far have not gone the way we wanted for our little guys. While baby A has grown and is in the 80th percentile, B has fallen a little more behind and is only in the 1st percentile. Both still have good fluid levels and heart rates, but B had elevated cord blood flow last week and absent yesterday.We are only 21 weeks and while St Luke‚Äôs can deliver as early as 22 weeks, our baby B would not survive, and it still would be so so risky for A.Besides growth restriction for baby B, they are both the healthiest little guys who won‚Äôt stay still during sonos.Again, we would appreciate prayers that we surprise the doctors and improve or at least not show reversed cord blood flow when we go back Thursday, and can hold on for a long time to get both of these babes much bigger!We are so thankful for everyone checking in and praying!! ‚ù§Ô∏è #siugr #identicaltwins #moditwins |||1. Tyler and I are having twins, yay!2. They are being closely monitored at St Luke's for growth restriction, sIUGR. Baby B, while still keeping up at this point, has fallen behind quite a bit. Since they share a placenta, this could affect both babies and progress quickly. We would appreciate prayers that Baby B can gain some ground, and very soon. The doctor is consulting with other hospitals, and we go back Thursday. Praying we get hopeful news! |||The purple asparagus this year. üòã |||After Thanksgiving dinner walk.

Lots of great fresh veggies are produced here. Like potatoes! #notjustrice #hokkaido #myjapanlife |||Today is the third Sunday in June. Many around the world know it as Father‚Äôs Day. Today is also the first time I won‚Äôt be able to call or visit my own  dad for Father‚Äôs Day. I won‚Äôt be able to remind him that it‚Äôs his turn in Words With Friends...which is fine because he‚Äôs usually kicked my ass! I‚Äôve been through my own birthday, Christmas, New Year his birthday and even Mother‚Äôs Day...which is important because I‚Äôd usually use a face-time call to him to say ‚ÄúHappy Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù to my Japanese mom.There will be more firsts that I haven‚Äôt thought of yet, I‚Äôm sure. But through all of that I have the memories of the days before I first came to Japan, when he would eat dinner with a cockatoo on his shoulder. Or, how incredibly dry humored he was by wearing his assortment of wigs during chemo therapy. He was rarely happier than when visiting a Rotary club he‚Äôd never been to and presenting a banner.  On a few occasions I was able to do that with him, also as a Rotarian.  Another occasion that was also special for me as well was attending my Marine Corps retirement here in Japan. But I think it would be extremely difficult to find a time when he was happier than the day he met his great-grandson for the first time.I‚Äôll continue to remember, and I‚Äôll continue to miss him. I‚Äôll find old pictures I haven‚Äôt seen in years. And I‚Äôll add those memories to continue filling the void. I‚Äôve been down other roads with no map, so I‚Äôll just keep looking ahead and doing the best I can.If you‚Äôve read this far and you‚Äôre a father, happy Father‚Äôs Day! If you have a father, don‚Äôt miss the chance to tell them how you appreciate them. If you can‚Äôt do that with your own father, we all have one in our lives. Reach out to them and let them know how important they are.#fathersday #missingdad #celebratedads #missyoudad |||My niece said ‚ÄúOH my god!

kaethend,esfj,0,1,0,1," |||You‚Äôll never not be my favorite things. |||Tomorrow marks four years since I stepped foot onto campus. This post is probably as much acknowledgement of that day as I‚Äôll get since after all this time I am *still* a CW. Do I not know how to get full time work? Maybe. Or perhaps staying on project-based jobs has allowed me to learn and grow and advance faster than if I were in the system. Time and time again I have been handed a problem I have never solved before, but all the resources and trust I need to figure it out.For the last year I have been cataloging an entire department‚Äôs body of work ten years deep. It is as massive as it sounds. Did I know how to do this when I started? Nope. Did I figure it the fuck out and then also create a DAM from the ground up with a taxonomy and metadata scheme? Hell yes.I am exhausted, but I am also never not happy to go to work. Not once (ok, maybe once right after parental leave I had a meltdown) have I ever dreaded work. I love what I do where I do it.I have been seated in five of our seven buildings on Classic and I took a meeting in the first building on the very floor right next to where I first sat four years ago. Walking out back to my current desk I ran smack into this on the wall. This was my OG team, now disbanded, here on the wall. I don‚Äôt know how to describe this moment other than that it feels like the work we do matters because while it‚Äôs pixels and comes down as fast as it goes up, it also finds its way onto paper and then left up on a wall for years. üíô |||Bunny, Grace O‚ÄôMalley, Midnight Sunshine, Becky von Pecky, and Indigo #chickenmath |||Babies babies babies |||Achievement unlocked. ‚ÄúMaybe they have show and tell in college and I can show them my cut off cast with all my friends‚Äô names on it.‚Äù |||‚ÄúSay, cheese, monster truck.‚Äù |||January be like |||Today was f*cking dumb until my people took me out for dinner and cupcakes.

I didn‚Äôt take many pictures, but I did get a pretty good shot of Jaxon riding his tricycle around the campground in some Christmas PJs. |||Yesterday the girls and I got to go on our first outdoor climbing trip with the @vitalclimbinggym Murrieta youth team. They did an amazing job climbing, hiking, and hauling gear from boulder to boulder. It was a long and tiring day, but something we‚Äôre all looking forward to doing again. |||We used to end our Disney days with beignets, but now we can‚Äôt head home until we have a bag of pastries from Porto‚Äôs. |||Jenni‚Äôs taking a moment to enjoy a couple of her Christmas gifts before we start preparing for dinner. üéÑüòÑ |||This morning while we were cleaning the house, Jaxon wandered into our closet and spotted a gift we put together for him last night. He lit up and wouldn‚Äôt stop saying ‚Äúcar!‚Äù So we had to let him have it a little early. |||We forgot to leave room for Santa‚Äôs gifts. Guess we need to open some today! üòÑ |||Every year around the holidays I make eggnog for friends and family, but I‚Äôm usually left with a lot of spare egg whites. This year I tried to use them by making meringue cookies at first, then someone reminded me that the deviled eggs at Juniper and Ivy use a meringue instead of a hard boiled egg white so I gave that a shot yesterday and they turned out surprisingly good! I think this is going to be a new holiday tradition to go along with the eggnog. |||Boiled, peeled and separated through my lunch. Tonight I‚Äôll turn all this into meringue deviled eggs and a couple batches of eggnog. |||I honestly thought the grilled cheese donut was going to be like novelty fair food, but it was actually one of my favorites from the night. It‚Äôs massive, and filling, but surprisingly delicious. |||To-go donuts and swag from the VIP grand opening last night at @donutbar Temecula! |||What an experience! Last night we got to checkout the brand new @donutbar in Temecula and it was amazing! The girls had a blast trying all the amazing donuts and we ended the night with a champagne toast. ü•Çüç©üòç |||We‚Äôre always so busy with day to day life, working and wrangling the kids, that we get caught up in being parents and forget we‚Äôre a couple. After a long day at Disneyland, I looked at @fitcoachjenni and felt like I‚Äôd barely seen her all day. I told the kids to move out of the way so I could take a picture of my wife. üòò |||Rainy Disney Day! |||Took @fitcoachjenni to The Crack Shack for the first time. The food was incredible, but Jenni was excited to get a tiki drink with the good ice. |||It‚Äôs been several months of work, about half through contractors and half @fitcoachjenni and I working through weekends, but we finally have our new patio complete with a nice place to relax, can lights, a fan, misters, and new fruit trees all setup on drip lines. |||It‚Äôs been nine years since we got married. Every year life gets both more challenging and more rewarding. I‚Äôm happy that we‚Äôre in it together. Happy Anniversary @fitcoachjenni! I love you. üòò |||Took a day off work to finish up some landscaping projects. Spent the better part of the day moving dirt, DG, and concrete, but I finished converting our awkward planters and half of a dead lawn into a trampoline area. Next step is to clean up and reseed the rest of the lawn by the pool. #summeriscoming |||The girls spent the night with @cathyt1357 last night so we got to dinner and finally catch Avengers: Infinity War, but this morning it was time to put in work. @fitcoachjenni and I got rid of a shed that had been taking up part of our side yard since we moved in, now we‚Äôre reusing some of the old concrete planter border to make a dedicated trampoline area. Jaxon is supervising. |||Thanks? |||I‚Äôm at a tough point in my climbing progression. I still struggle to start red (V4-5) climbs, but I can get most orange (V2-3) on the first attempt. This morning I worked on starting a few reds, then hit all the oranges on the boulder.",9

laurie_porr,isfj,1,1,0,1," |||Decide. And GO!! |||This child is my sunshine! üåû This big smile makes every day worth living. His old soul is the sweetest, most understanding of anyone I know. He is simply the best, better than all the rest. And, I'm probably biased and I'm ok with that. |||And just like that.....I'm the mom of two teen boys and a 20 year old daughter.Yesterday my baby became a teenager. The big 1-3. And, it's one of the biggest honors of my life, to usher him into this period of his life. |||So worth it. |||This year I am focusing on targeting inflammation in my body. I suffer from migraines.  I experience depression and anxiety. I've been feeling sluggish and fatigued this past year. I know that inflammation can be a major factor in all of this.I've started drinking celery juice daily. I have started using hemp CBD oils daily. I will be focusing on a more plant based diet and eliminating some foods that typically cause inflammation.This whole search for my best life is constantly ongoing.  I know there is no such thing as a quick fix.  Slowly incorporating all the things I am learning will get me where I want to be. I am always stopping to appreciate exactly where I am though. Life IS good!!! What are your best tips to reduce inflammation? .What are you doing this year to improve your overall health? |||All three of my babies were together on Christmas morning. Dream come true!! |||This boy is about to get the change of his little life. He has scoliosis. Before Christmas he is getting fitted for a back brace. Just in to the new year he will get that brace. He has to wear it 17 hours a day until he stops growing. That's about 4 years.Not gonna lie. This is freaking me out BIG TIME.  We have faced many challenges together. My committment is strong. My love it deep. His stubborn streak hasn't broken me.....yet. This will be a huge test for both of us. He will resist, most likely violently. I will have to dig deep into my reserve of patience with him.Together....we got this!! |||It's December. Christmas is in less than 23 days. üò± Gifts have to be purchased. Cookies made.  Houses decorated. Parties attended. School events juggled. Work obligation met.I'm here to remind you to take time to take care of yourself. Take that longer shower. Eat that healthy snack instead of cookies. Go for a walk with a friend. Linger around the tree with your kids. Kiss your loved ones under the mistletoe. Cherish the little things.Don't let the business  of this time rob you of the precious moments that are surely present. |||TEN YEAR CHALLENGE.2009 vs. 2019 |||Holding myself accountable. I'm in charge of me. I decide how I treat my body. I make the changes. I hold the cards. I'm the only one that can. I choose my fate.Are you taking responsibility for you? Treating yourself the way you deserve to be treated? It's your choice. |||One of my all time favorite pictures of these two gems from 2011.I've been watching them interact more closely lately. In part, because they actually interact.It's been a rough road of jealousy between them growing up. Finley gets treated differently by my ex husband for being ""normal"". Jasmine got special, unwanted, attention from me for being so sick growing up. Guilt, gender, age, circumstance....caused me to parent them very differently. And they are both growing up with a profoundly handicapped brother who requires 24/7 attention that causes a ripple in everything.I am proud of them for sticking it through all the crap. They are really starting to bond and it is beautiful. When they see each other now, they enjoy each other. Finally, laughter is erupting. Hugs are being returned. Goofiness takes place. I love yous are exchanged.It's never to late to make it better. Life is short. Love your family. Make opportunities. Don't give up! Keep getting together even when it's painful. Things can, and do, change. |||Thank you for following along in my corner of the internet. Can't wait to get to know you all and share my passions with each of you!!! |||You deserve all good things life has to offer! |||Just popping in to say hello. Just want to remind you that you are worth it and you are loved! You are not alone, ever, unless you choose to be. You matter! |||This tiny guy!! He just finished his mountain biking season. I am so impressed with his grit and determination. Is he the fastest kid out there? Not yet. Is he pouring his heart into every practice and race? Absolutely! He started and finished every time on his bike with a smile knowing he gave his all.So proud of Finley for his commitment to being his very best EVERY SINGLE TIME. When I grow up I want to be just like him! |||These two little men have grown places in my heart I didn't know existed. I never knew I wanted a boy. I grew up in a house with two sisters. I had no idea. But God, he knew I NEEDED them. Can't imagine a second without my boys.#nationalsonday #Godknew |||I made a commitment to myself about 2 months ago to take better care of myself. Make better food choices. Rest when I'm tired. Move more when I can. Drink my superfood shakes to nourish my body.  Work on my mental strength and depression. Wear clothes that make me feel good about myself. Wear makeup. Speak up more. Ask for help. Spread more positive into the world.These are the physical changes that you can see. The ones on the inside are looking better too.It's never to late to start again. And then.....again. Life is a long journey. Just keep going. You can choose to make tomorrow better than today.So, what are you doing tomorrow? |||When God was picking mother/daughter pairs, I hit the jackpot! I am blessed to call this beautiful woman MINE!Life has handed us quite a few challenges in our 20 years together. Some rocked us to the core. One thing that has never been shaken is my love for this girl. It has never wavered and has only gotten stronger. We have been pushed to the edge a few times but we will never ever break.I love you baby girl!! #nationaldaughterday |||My son called this my ""mom-chete"". When I signed up for mountain bike trail maintenance, I had no idea I would spend two hours wielding a machete. I had muscles crying the next day that I didn't even know I owned.Seeing this video reminded me that I have held that ""mom-chete"" before. I looked much different at different times in my fight for my kids. Through chronic illnesses, educational advocacies, hospitalizations, therapies, divorce.It also reminded me that I need to swing that machete for myself. Get in the trenches and fight for what I need to be healthy and well. Stick up for my health. Fight for my marriage. Treat myself with love. Fight for ME!! ü§∫What part if your life do YOU need to get whacking on? Go grab that machete and GET TO WORK!! |||Some days I struggle with confidence and......thankfully some days I don't.Today was a good day. |||Every time I walk up to my house I see this girl faintly reflected in the glass on my front storm door. As I get healthier, I am starting to like her more. She is slimmer. She has a pep to her step. She stands up straighter. I want to take better care of her. 2019 isn't over yet!!! |||I got my emotions crumpled up and left in a big pile this week. Sending my special needs child back to school is like a kick in the gut. I should expect it by now but it still gets me.Sending him off forces me to face our future. A future where I won't be there anymore. When I'm too old for him to come home to. When I can't take care of him anymore. Those thoughts haunt me. I can't lie. I can hide them most of the time and live one day at a time. Some days I can't.I don't stay there long. I'm getting back up. I took a long hot shower. Cried it out a little. Getting my shit pulled back together. Things just got real. And that's ok.Next! |||It's just their opinion. Again, none of your business. #ignorethemall |||It's me here, reminding you to get up and get dressed and love yourself today.You see, I understand. I wanted to stay on the couch all day in my pajamas. It's the last few days of summer vacation here. I wanted to veg and do nothing. But, I realize that doing nothing is letting a day pass by that I can never get back. A day I give myself less than I deserve. A day my kids have less than the mom they should have.So, I got up, got dressed and tried that new mascara I got the other day. You like?What are YOU doing today? Make it your best!! |||Just a reminder....incase you weren't sure.You are enough.You deserve the best.You are worth it.And you don't need anyone else to be this way. Love yourself first and always. |||Quick tip to make a high protein quick snack.Crack 2 eggs in a coffee mug.Scramble.Stick in the microwave.Heat for 30 seconds and re-scramble.Repeat until egg is cooked.Top with cheese of choice.Enjoy! üç≥Eating healthy doesn't have to be hard, messy or take much time.Have an egg-cellent weekend! (üòâ) |||This is 45. Take it or leave it.But I wasn't always this confident. It's taken me years of thinking what I would have said.....after the fact. I used to let people decide things for me. I would just go with the flow. Follow the crowd.Then......I decided I wasn't going to put up with that anymore. I changed my mindset. I changed my attitude. I stood up. I took control. I started being ME!! And being me feels great!! Are you being YOU?!? |||This was me the last few days. Just not feeling it. Many reasons. Won't go into that.What I can tell you is that I didn't let my circumstances sidetrack me from taking care of myself. I ate clean, loved on my kids and did what I needed to do to love myself. I made a commitment to do my very best and not give up.What does that commitment look like? It means not turning to junk food, like I would have in the past. It means following my meal plan and tracking my intake. It means not punishing myself if I stray from my plan. Not considering my whole day blown if I eat a cookie. Just building it in to my day and keep going. It's being kind to ME. I do it because I'm worth it.You wanna know something? YOU are worth it too!!! |||Look who's back. .Drop the drums, here it comes, only got one minute to bounce, and every second counts .I made a commitment today to get out of my own way and stop believing my own excuses. I'm going to get real. I'm going to love myself and speak to myself kindly. I'm not going to quit. This shit is getting real.",5

lnebres,isfp,1,1,0,0," |||On the way back to town from Makena... |||58¬∞NE ... a clear manifestation of the intense atmospherics of the day yet to unwind. |||Lono'ikamakahiki! |||(She's there alright.) ""...he mele n≈ç Poliahu."" |||A chilly, densely overcast morning at the pond; so there will be no sun rising to be seen. But Poliahu is there behind and above those clouds, atop Haleakala‚Äîso it will be good to dance with her into the day, with Maunakea Kuahiwi right here... |||Held 'Aha Awakea here again this noon, after cuz @kaaihueahpuck sold me one of his own Apolima that he was wearing on his arm‚Äîmahalo nui loa, kia'i! I was doing the pule, oli, mele and hula by myself until this little kid came over and sat by the red kia'i pareo that I'd lain on the stony beach. Earlier, he'd been chatting with cuz Konapiliahi in fluent Hawaiian. Kona said he and many kids from the valley attend the Hawaiian Immersion program at Princess Nahienaena Elementary in Lahaina. So anyway, the kid (what did you say his name was, cuz?)‚Äîwho was no older than kindergarten‚Äîjust sat there near me, playing with the ili'ili and a couple of sticks... and watching me chant ""O Hanau Ka Mauna."" But when that was pau and I started dancing ""Maunakea Kuahiwi,"" he began singing along‚Äîwith perfect fluency and pitch! If you can imagine a barefoot little boy‚Äîblonde, blue-eyed... singing in Hawaiian along with my dancing, you can imagine both my delight and feeling of extraordinary grace. KƒÅnaka truly manifest in many forms, don't they? |||If y'all follow me here on social media‚Äîand you live on this tiny island‚Äîit still baffles me somewhat as to why you haven't asked to come with and join me at sunrise 'Aha at this place of deep mana and exquisite beauty. And it's not like I've not explicitly invited y'all... have done so more than a few times, actually. ;-) Well anyway, this place will still be here, and our stand to hold space and time with the Maunakea kia'i and k≈´puna of indefinite duration... until the last aloha aina. |||I took my kupuna friend Nur Gibson‚Äîan architect, watercolor artist, and Sufi mystic‚Äîto join me at sunrise 'Aha this morning. As she is somewhat housebound due to a neurological condition that doesn't let her be out in the sun during the day, she hardly gets to go out, so this was a treat. Nur was stunned at the colours and the tone of the time... |||Daybreak this morning‚ÄîLƒÅ 204‚Äîwas once again of pewter and silver, with shards of roseate crimson slashing through the horizon. ||| ªAi kamumu kƒìkƒì...Nakƒìkƒì pƒÅhoehoe, kƒì!! |||Kaikuwa ka pahuI  ªo Haumea aA kele a kiuA kelekele a kiu |||E ulu i ka lani...E ulu i ka honua... |||NƒÅ  ªaumƒÅkua mai ka lƒÅ hiki a ka lƒÅ kau... |||E KƒÅnehoalani ƒì...E KƒÅnehoalani ƒì...‚Ä®...Aloha kƒÅua! |||Daybreak, LƒÅ 204... |||Not sure why... but this cloudscape above the mauna right now is speaking to me, in a language as clear as the noonday sky. |||We're being really expressive right now, aren't we? ;-) |||Here are some lovely strips of cloud above Mauna Kahalawai just now... |||I was already a ways from the circled space of 'Aha concluded that evening, when I heard footfalls and a voice call my name, ""Uncle Lloyd!"" Turned around to see him as he had come running to bid me aloha ... had his mother sent him or had he arrived on his own volition? Either way, it was a gift. A warm embrace aloha and I remembered what it was I didn't realize I'd forgotten: the pure, unalloyed kindness of a child. And, in this one, an olden soul wrapped in the fresh garments of youth, bidding me this: remember, remember, remember. |||A lustrous skein of silver, pewter and pearl rapts the surface of things here right now... |||Lono looking down at me as I begin my pule NƒÅ 'AumƒÅkua... |||Before sunrise. |||This morning's Lono-inflected solar explosion, just now... |||After sunset 'Aha Maunakea this evening... |||LƒÅ 180... ""E KaÃÑnehoalani eÃÑ..."" |||Rainclouds sweeping upcountry from the northeast at the moment... |||After the last notes of the closing p≈´ wafted away to the mauna it started to rain, and everyone dispersed fairly soon, after the quick hugs and honi. I lay on the wet grass, exhausted after my day, lingering in the light shower, which soon passed. Had folks stayed, like they usually do, they'd have seen this. üòâ |||On this morning‚ÄîLƒÅ 174‚ÄîI danced the ""'Au'a 'ia"" in a way I hadn't previously... as it all came together: time, history, self, being. |||The first sunrise of the year begins overcast, with low-slung clouds, lingering overhead in the absence of a breeze; but... |||Ya know, lƒÅhui? Three is a very good number for 'Aha. Here this noon: tutu Mary, young kia'i Kahi'au, and me. And kakou. :-)",1

A friend of his was redesigning a huge building in a small town and wanted to turn it into a collection of shops designed by different creators. He wanted Derrick to dream big and design a bookstore.Derrick told me his plan for Fascination Station. It was to be a train station, with a checkout counter modeled after Grand Central stations information kiosk. It would have cubby holes for reading, set into in the back wall designed like bunks on a train car. Large displays would be inset in arches showing landscapes rolling by. Travel posters advertising departure times for famous fictional destinations would hang on one wall, and shelves would roll away, so folding chairs could pull out from a secret compartment and an audience could watch authors read from the back of a full size caboose, as if they were on a whistle-stop tour.It sounded wonderful, and Derrick wanted me to draw it.While I make detailed 3D models for my comics, I‚Äôd never designed something like this. Something that was to become an actual physical place. Something that needed to fit in exact dimensions and be usable by flesh and blood people. It was a heck of a lot of fun, and the illustration came together in no time.Fascination Station Book Store overhead viewAn overhead view of Fascination Station ‚Äì a Write Bloody BookstoreSadly, things fell through.

It‚Äôs cracking me up! Now this is going to be fun! I really enjoy this group I have found. It‚Äôs a way for me to connect to my hobbies on a daily basis and enjoy #fandom that I have always loved.

I superglued her and the little soot sprite to the stump. ‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£‚Å£The moss I ordered online and the other plants I got from the garden, but I have heard they work well in terrariums.

By speaking of perversion my audience too had to consider it, an audience that you cannot know so cannot trust to think responsibly.

The arch was moved over the reactor on wheels and it‚Äôs the biggest object of it‚Äôs kind in the world. The 4.th reactor exploded on 26th of April 1986 whilst leaking an uprecedented amount of radiation in the atmosphere. On the beside monument, you can see the reactor covered by the original protective layer called the sarcophagi. Embracing hands symbolize hard work and sacrifice which was put in the mission of liquidation of the tragic aftermath.2 Port cafe of Pripyat (–ü—Ä–∏–ø—è—Ç—å).The city of Pripyat was once the most progressive, young and fast-growing cities in the Soviet Union. This port caf√© served as the place of hanging out and also in/out point for the people coming to the city by the boats from surrounding suburbs of the growing Pripyat. People who lived their relatively prosperous lives here had to leave their homes forever within a few hours. Can you imagine to do so yourself?3 Hospital number 6.The hospital which hospitalized the firemen from the first round of Chernobyl firefighting. All 17 firemen were transferred to the special clinic in Moscow and died within one month. In the movie, the relatives of these brave were gathered by the gate with no permission to access the building. Irina Ignatenko, the real story character, managed to sneak in but was not on time to see her husband here. She went to Moscow.4 Hotel Polissya (–ü–æ–ªicc—è).After the accident immediate action had to be taken. Valery Legasov (nuclear physicist) and Boris Scherbina (state representative) were leading and observing the quelling operations of the exploded core from the roof of the hotel Polissya which was distanced a few km from the reactor. For both, this mission was deadly in the end. |||Happy happy #2020 #empirestateofmind prani: #dontfuckitup |||Living my best life.. occasionally |||Deep thoughts and high expectations..

The other is that I‚Äôm kicking around the idea of a stargazing/astrophotography party sometime this summer. Maybe dinner around a fire, then photography and sky watching, cameras, telescopes and binoculars encouraged but not necessary. Something like that.

sillysnailmm,isfp,1,1,0,0," |||I greatly appreciate Nicole and Olga for this wonderful two-day workshop. Everything and every detail is well prepared and amazingly prefect, bringing a fruitful journey to fine art and macro photography. I‚Äôm extremely excited to be introduced to brand new topics, especially fine arts settings/posing/details . What‚Äôs more very grateful for Nicole share us her amazing nature work shoot along which made me much more inspiration.Though there is a far way to go before reaching the line of perfection of fine arts, I‚Äôm quite confident that this workshop has been a great starting to a long-term exploration and enhancement in my hobbyist photography experience.

In this case, we missed our flight due to a train strike in Paris and are currently hanging at a hotel by the airport until tomorrow. @angelahartwig managed to find some new (somewhat reasonable) tickets home, but we‚Äôre having to extend the travel time by a couple more days to make it work. Last minute international flight x 5 = üò≥ |||The Louvre, a nice lunch to escape the rain, and the Eiffel. Going out with a bang. So glad we had a knowledgeable guide for the Louvre ‚Äî it was crazy in there. I have a time lapse video that perfectly captures just how insane it was, but it‚Äôs not long enough to meet the Instagram minimum. Homeward bound tomorrow, after which point I will spare you all the photos! |||The big day today. We‚Äôve been wanting to get the kids to a Grand Slam tournament final for several years, specifically to see Nadal or Federer play and hopefully win. It worked out well! Nadal is so very dominant again. We all had a blast. |||Bike tour day. Not my favorite tour ever, but the scenery was definitely amazing. Wrapped up the day at the Arc and Champs-√âlys√©es. |||An amazing day today, taking in the men‚Äôs semi-finals of Roland Garros.

We wrapped the day with a legitimate French meal at La Jacobine, which happens to be situated on the greatest little Parisian walking street (that we know of). |||Hello Paris! A quick flight in, a test of French McDonald‚Äôs, a walking tour of our neighborhood and dinner outside after dark. So happy to be back! |||See ya later, Barcelona! |||A chill last day in Barcelona. Tapas around the corner, a stroll to the Picasso Museum, outside dining and some downtime in prep for departure tomorrow. Barcelona is everything it is cracked up to be. |||Barcelona day two! One word = Epic. We woke up late, strolled to the water, had lunch there, sat on the beach for a bit then returned to our AirBnB to surprise the boys with a sidecar motorcycle tour of Barcelona. I love this place... Gaud√≠ architecture abounds. Sidestreets to explore.... could imagine being an ex-pat here. Now to learn Spanish.... |||Hello Barcelona! We had a crazy travel day with cancelled trains, AirBnB alarms going off and a bit of culture shock coming from London, but this place seems cool. We‚Äôre a bit overwhelmed after a long day, but looking forward to exploring Barca for a couple days. |||Last day in London! Wimbledon tour, hype shopping in Soho and Covent Garden, Shake Shack and pool time. Best day yet? The jury is still out on that, but this one is in the running. |||Busy day in London. Colonel‚Äôs Review, High Tea and a West End theatre show! It was our ‚Äúproper attire‚Äù day and a lot of fun. BTW, @angelahartwig has some amazing photos from this trip. I‚Äôm not doing it justice! |||Day Three! Harry Potter studio tour, a quick impromptu train ride back to London, wrapped up with dinner on Carnaby Street. The amount of detail that went into the Harry Potter series is absolutely mind-blowing. Also, Watford, where the studio is located seems lovely. üëç |||Day Two in London. I love how this city doesn‚Äôt give a rip about blending old and new. Today, we hit a hop on / hop off bus tour, the Tower of London and some shopping. Time to recharge for tomorrow. |||The London Eye! Ronan wanted to make it happen. Great views of the city on our first day here and now we‚Äôre all about to crash.

This is a set of @hedwheels Ardennes Plus GP 25mm wheels with @wildernesstrailbikes Riddler 45mm tires set up tubeless. Big, beefy and cush. Finished off with some SRAM centerline rotors to play nice with the @paulcomponent Klamper brakes, and a Shimano XT 11-42 cassette that matches my other setup.

If we are grieving this way I can't even imagine what the family is going through; losing the #Mamba and the little #Mambacita at the same time.Death serves as a reminder that tomorrow is not promised, hell the next minute is not promised.  Each day is truly a gift, another chance to make a positive impact on this world, another opportunity to be great. Let's not waste our time on foolish things and foolish people.RIP Kobe and GiannaMy condolences to and prayers for the families of all those that lost their lives in this tragic accident. |||My @Saints ""fleur de tree"".

I can only hope people remember me as fondly as they remember her when my time on Earth is done.This woman was one of the kindest souls I've ever known. She didn't care how many people we brought to New Orleans with us, everyone was welcomed at her home. She'd feed us when we were hungry, make our Mardi Gras and Bayou Classic hangover breakfasts, and dish out wisdom the same way she served up gumbo, in huge portions. She was a true lady and dedicated her life to the students of New Orleans and the church.When I woke up this morning it was pouring rain, as if the city itself were mourning with us.Rest in Peace, Aunt Alice. Thank you for everything, I love you dearly. |||At the happiest place on Earth. Celebrating the grand opening of Susie Cakes Long Beach! |||This little girl is one of the sweetest in the world!

I had a hard time finding a board that would fit the Ilex No. 4 shutter that came with the Kodak Wide Field Ektar 190mm/f6.3 lens I picked up recently. So I opened up Fusion 360 and made one, which I then printed on my Ender 3 Pro. First attempt didn‚Äôt work; the hole was based on some specs I read online and was too small, and I hadn‚Äôt accounted for the rounded corners. Also it wasn‚Äôt quite thick enough and so wasn‚Äôt rigid enough. So back to Fusion 360, doubled the thickness to 4mm and added a circle to the back for another 2mm of support. The result looks promising.

I don‚Äôt have a lot of these, unless you count my large format cameras, which are just big boxes (yeah, no...). But they did mention a couple of cameras that I *do* have. These were shot back in 2007 with my #agfaclack , a lovely little camera that shoots 6x9 on 120 film. The camera was made at a time when film was slow, so the shutter speed for the camera is along the lines of 1/30 of a second, which means that you can shoot indoors with 3200 speed film.

All the appropriate lenses I could find on eBay were like $300 apiece. Then there was a Mamiya Press Universal camera on the site that had a 75mm lens attached. The price? $300. So it was like getting the camera for free. It came with a Polaroid back, so when it showed up today, I loaded it with some Fuji FP-100C and went into the backyard for a few minutes. Camera seems to work just fine. #film #polaroid #packfilm #fp100c #filmphotography #staybrokeshootfilm |||art BOX#olympusxa #agfacolor #film #filmphotography #staybrokeshootfilm #boardwalk #wildwood #wildwoodnj |||How much does @njtransit suck?

They‚Äôre a DIY punk band from the DC area who play some of the most jagged and adventurous music around. Their 2014 EP ‚ÄòBodies and Control and Money and Power‚Äô was enough to have me hooked; but this one is a stunner. Where their previous work was a roller coaster, this one is ride through the madhouse. If you have any interest in music that strives for something more than the usual, this is the album to listen to.St. Vincent is possibly one of the top 5 living guitarists on the planet. It might be hard to tell sometimes as her guitar sounds are warped and mangled into modern art. I have a high suspicion she‚Äôs actually an alien who landed in Texas years ago.  If any one person is carrying the spirit of Prince and David Bowie today, it‚Äôs St. Vincent.  This album will take your brain somewhere it didn‚Äôt expect to go.Both albums are highly recommended. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

A magnificent final statement.If one has to leave this life, there‚Äôs no better way to do it than Mr. Bowie did.  Blackstar is not just his last album, but one of his best.I was lucky enough to get a leak of this album from the internets a week before it was released. It sounded fresh and amazing in that week.  Full of life, wonderment and vigor. It took on an additional layer of brilliance once David left us.So really, this album is album of the year twice, once for just being astoundingly good and another for being the best farewell album in the history of rock and roll.  A perfectly planned release for the world.There are few words to describe the brilliance of this. Just listen and be thankful we all lived in the time of Bowie. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

Had this album come out in 1985, it would have been my favorite album then too. It‚Äôs timely and timeless.It‚Äôs a pretty relentless barrage of crust, ska, hardcore and a few tracks that will take even the most jaded punk by surprise.I grabbed this album initially because it had a song by the amazing Jesse Michaels (Operation Ivy, Classics of Love) doing guest vocals on a track and just kept spinning the whole thing.I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt intended as such, but it‚Äôs my workout album, I run D-Beat style.Not for everyone, but those that know it, love it. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

From Jersey? Who did a concept album about the life of Peter Lorre?I don‚Äôt think so.I caught Inferno fever in 2004, when (for some reason) they were the opening act for New Model Army at the Bottom Lounge in Chicago.As soon as they started playing, a giant grin planted itself on my face and didn‚Äôt let go. It was love at first listen. It was loud, jaunty, rough, slinky, funny and dead serious all at the same time.They still are, and despite their ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Care!‚Äù attitude, they‚Äôre incredibly sentimental. This album proves it. It‚Äôs a wake, disguised as a record for the singer Grace Talicious (from the band The Paranoid Style... also the topic of the song ‚ÄòYour Younger Man‚Äô). It‚Äôs an album full of thoughts of mortality and loss, wrapped in their usual gleeful and melancholy music.  Not that there aren‚Äôt still songs about mischief and running from the cops.It also contains a line I understand fully: ‚ÄúI feel the universe is trying to tell me something, But I don't speak enough Spanish to understand it‚ÄùGet this one immediately. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

Luckily, I gave this one a listen. The vinyl version is a two-parter of an album. Apparently there is a Part 1 and a Part 2.Together they‚Äôre seamless and brilliant, so another reason I‚Äôm glad I got the whole package at once.Describing this album is sort of like trying to remember a dream and explain it to someone as bits of it come back to you. Seemingly a bunch of unconnected moments that begin to coalesce into a singular, remarkable memory as you work your way through them.So very recommended. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

Who is it and why are they playing the song I wish would play when I walked into a room?After their superb debut, the Vaccines returned with this gem, full of great songs, biting lyrics and hooks for days.I don‚Äôt know how anyone could not love this album.Their following albums... well, it‚Äôs understandable if you don‚Äôt love them.This album has spun at least once a week for the last 6 years. It‚Äôs really that good. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

Sometimes reversed.This album is my favorite of his LPs, (all of which are pretty fantastic), but this one hit my happy brain spot especially hard.  Ringing guitars, hopeful lyrics, upbeat ‚ÄúGrowed-Up Punk Approved (TM)‚Äù songs. ‚ÄúThe path I chose isn't straight and narrow, It wanders around like a drunken fellow‚ÄùFrank has the wonderful ability (rare to but a handful of songwriters) where every song has a personal relevance to the listener.

By this point, their music is pretty iconic, and oddly has a highly identifiable Andy Summers‚Äô guitar influence. The band have covered the Police‚Äôs ‚ÄòMessage in a Bottle‚Äô before and I think they pick up cues here and there from the more interesting parts of the Police.The album starts with ‚ÄúGod is Dead He's buried in my shed, The free market is still not dead, Wartime leaders get Nobel peace prizes, God is dead, He's definitely dead‚Äù and ends with ‚ÄúNever give up hope. Never give up hope‚Äù and everything in-between is astounding.I have an odd suspicion of people who don‚Äôt love Van Morrison; while they‚Äôre the other end of the spectrum, I don‚Äôt fully trust people who don‚Äôt love Leatherface.Also, if anyone can explain this as anything but modern poetry, please try ‚ÄúThat frock could cure a duck with chronic hiccups faster than a fat man can do the sit ups‚Äù ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

It has the NMA sound we all love, but turned up to 11‚Ä¶ both in volume and intensity.The guitar is simply crushing. Like those giant iron wrecking balls swinging wildly.  Justin‚Äôs voice, delivery and lyrics are timely and feral.  The songs are magically a level above the last couple albums. (Overall, it‚Äôs hard to judge any NMA album against another, there are a handful that are masterpiece-level, and there are some like Carnival, which might be their weakest album.  One thing tho: Carnival Fucking Rocks.  So set that as your baseline). I was fortunate enough to see the band tour this album. The last US tour they did.They tend to play to thousands around the world, but in Detroit they played to about a hundred. I know it must be both soul-crushing and financially horrible to tour the states when the numbers are low; but I‚Äôve seen them 4 times here and each time I‚Äôm about 3 feet from the band, so it‚Äôs hard to not want them to come back. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

I‚Äôd been a fan of their debut and initially wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of this album.  It lacked the odd quirkiness of their first that I loved. But, as with most undeniable albums, I couldn‚Äôt resist for long.Seriously, give a listen to Waving Flags and tell me you don‚Äôt immediately love it.A classic LP from a vastly under-rated band. I highly recommend becoming slightly obsessed with them.If you‚Äôre a fan of this album, check out their 2013 release ‚ÄúFrom The Sea To The Land Beyond‚Äù which contains re-versioned tracks as the soundtrack to a documentary about living near the British Seas (go figure they‚Äôd be the perfect band for this). ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

I did see bands at both of those place, and I‚Äôm fairly certain one of them was the Gaslight Anthem.  Something made me hunt down this record in 2007 back when it wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúFirst Pressing,‚Äù it was ‚ÄúOnly Pressing.‚Äù I‚Äôm glad I did find it, as it became one of my favorite albums and bands‚Ä¶ even after they got big and started sliding away from their original sound.And yes, I did have to show it‚Äôs on the peppermint swirl vinyl first pressing. I‚Äôm certain there‚Äôs at least one vinyl nerd/Anthem fan out there who knows what that means. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

Waterloo Records not only had a vinyl section, but a NEW RELEASE vinyl section.At the time, I got a travel per diem of $45 a day, and could stuff myself silly at Taco Cabana for around $8. The remainder went to records.This one was being spun on the in-house stereo and immediately caught my ear; and also introduced me to No Idea Records (I know, I missed the first decade or so). If you‚Äôve never heard of Defiance, Ohio; or heard this album‚Ä¶ just run to your local and see if they have it.Likely they don‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs ok as the band has always made their music freely downloadable online.  No gimmicks, no signups, just ‚ÄòShare what ya got‚Äô style. Head over to http://defianceohio.terrorware.com to get some great music.There‚Äôs nothing I don‚Äôt love about this album‚Ä¶ or the albums they did prior to calling it a day‚Ä¶ but this one has some serious Andrew history. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

If you were alive in 2005, this albums was an eye-opening shot; just what was needed.It‚Äôs chaotic, calm, manic, dark and serene all wrapped up in one.If you can find the live performance of this album, it‚Äôs worth the hour.This is my black vinyl OG pressing from 2005, I‚Äôve hear the Vinyl Me, Please remaster is worth getting, but I‚Äôm a bit skeptical.

An astounding statement from a band who could easily be riding on their own coat-tails, but refuse to do so.It‚Äôs their best despite having the distinction of being the album that has their only bad song. Not every Bad Religion song is amazing, but only one is truly bad.The amazing songs on the album make it possible to overlook this clunker. (It‚Äôs ‚ÄúBoot Stamping on a Human Face Forever‚Äù btw). Punk might be dead, but its spirit won‚Äôt ever die. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

One listen will have you pining for more and desperately hunting down any information about the band. (Don‚Äôt bother, there‚Äôs very little to be found).

A simple metaphor for all the styles and influences he‚Äôs got on this album.The LP contains a Sandinista-level of diversity (minus the excess Dub tracks) and was a most welcome return by St. Joe. The songs are fascinating, wonderfully arranged and sung with a fervor the world had been missing.Tragically, this was the last LP he finished, with the equally magnificent Streetcore completed after his untimely death.There‚Äôs a lot of things I‚Äôd like to do if I had a time machine, but one would definitely be to go find Joe in 2001 and get him to stop smoking, eat a carrot or two and go see a doctor.The world is a better place with more Joe Strummer, this album proves it. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

(The US cover was bland as could be). They followed up with another great record, but like many bands, didn‚Äôt keep it going for more than a few albums.It‚Äôs unfortunate, especially as the three all seemed to be amazing musicians, when I saw them live, they traded instruments based on song and all played flawlessly.Maybe it‚Äôs time for a comeback, boys? ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

The Twilight Singers were good, but just didn‚Äôt have that swanky hotness of the Whigs.Find this album. ‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

No, that‚Äôs not quite right.How does anyone describe this album? It was conceived as an homage to a record label that doesn‚Äôt exist (the E.S.P. Part), meant to sound like many different fictional bands (the Stars part) who were on the non-existent label.Yet somehow it comes out as one of His Name is Alive‚Äôs tightest and most cohesive albums.It‚Äôs equally dark and sparkly, curious and poppy, and has some of the best songs the band (which is mostly Detroit artist/music genius Warren DeFever) have ever done.The band continues to twist and turn through various styles and is sometimes maddeningly hard to keep current with, they seemingly record about 1,600 songs at a time and then release them in flurries of albums and oddities and hand painted discs found only at one record store; but it‚Äôs well worth the effort.Find this album. Play it loudly during the day. Play it on your headphones at night. It‚Äôs perfect at all times.Also... it‚Äôs called Detroit Rock City for a reason.‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs 50 days?

Try getting through ‚ÄòNow They‚Äôll Sleep‚Äô without singing ‚ÄúYou know the shape my breath will take, before I let it out!‚Äù It‚Äôs impossible.1995 was a bummer for music.

An assload of rubber-stamped bands still banging about the grunge sound‚Ä¶ a shitload of britpop that was mildly interesting‚Ä¶ Trip hop‚Ä¶ Alanis Morisette‚Ä¶ about 114 albums from Wu Tang-ers... a grand (and yet frustrating) album from Bowie‚Ä¶. and me loving this album most.It was almost tied with Exit Planet Dust by the Chemical Brothers, but then I realized I never bothered to get that one on vinyl, so I must not love it too much.So yes, it‚Äôs King. Belly‚Äôs last album before going away for a couple decades or so, but definitely not the last great album Tanya Donelly put out.

Experimenting with a single display I realised the issues I had working on multiple displays I had. I also found out what the limitations of one display to avoid. Decided to go with two 4K displays running at native resolution! Both LG27UK600 (because an extra ¬£250 for USB-C option didn't see worth it) mounted on a dual monitor arm. So far, having used this for about 2 weeks on/off, it's been the best. Lots more pixels to output on, less physical space. Having it as two displays (rather than a single ultra-wide or super ultra-wide) means splitting work in a way that reflects my workflow. Few things to change still as well as some ‚Äúout of shot‚Äù features I added that I may talk about in the future. But yeah, enjoying my new home office setup! |||We‚Äôve been binge watching The Witcher this weekend.

Whilst I use Notes.app for quick captures and Notion for long term stuff, there‚Äôs times you need a doodle pad. So I got a tablet that I have spare and installed some drawing apps on it, I got a pen with a touch job on it and giving that a try. So far, awkward and not as fluid as pen to paper, but, having to do remote discussions using a digital white board app, it works amazing! Will see how it takes long term.

The second week I was working on some hardware configurations, and the parts were a bit awkward to work with so having the extra desk space was brilliant. Doing some more traditional development and research, that second monitor was sorely missed. I‚Äôm feeling going back to using a second display that‚Äôs ‚Äú1080‚Äù will be a step backwards. Whilst the point of a single monitor is focus, sometimes what you need to focus on requires a lot of space so even that secondary focus, to have it in view fully would benefit from a bigger display. I‚Äôve got a week and a bit of work left this year so still time to refine this setup before making the choice of to stick to single life or double up... or triple up!#desk #desksetup #deskspace #setupinspiration #ikeadesk #workstation #officeinspiration #homeoffice #minimal #minimalsetups #isetups #devlife #productivity #react #reactdev #electron #javascript #LGMonitor #LG #lg27UK600 |||Tree‚Äôs up, so time to have a glass of @lagavulinwhisky with the dude, @nickofferman... we‚Äôll, via a fireplace on YouTube.  #whisky #whiskey #scotch #singlemalt #bourbon #scotchwhisky #whiskylover #whiskyporn #whiskygram #drinks #instawhisky #alcohol #singlemaltwhisky #dram #drink #instadram #whiskytasting #christmas #christmastree |||Many thanks to Dave from @wessexwhiskyclub for sending these drams for me to sample!

For a start, it‚Äôs appeased the minimalist and focused approach I wanted on my physical desk; there‚Äôs more space and less in it making it feel more focused. On the desktop I‚Äôve enjoyed it, but I do miss a second screen at least sometimes. At work I leave my MacBook open but only have my bullet journal in view. I was making some patch updates to a personal project last night and felt I should have that extra screen there, but after some time I realised I was getting the things I wanted done quickly. See, without another screen you have to be focused on what you are doing; if you do have two different things on one screen, then it needs to be high value to take up precious pixels.#desk #desksetup #deskspace #setupinspiration #ikeadesk #workstation #officeinspiration #homeoffice #minimal #minimalsetups #isetups #devlife #productivity #react #reactdev #electron #javascript #LGMonitor #LG #lg27UK600 |||New sensor day so this bad boy comes out of my arm after two weeks.
